  <h2>KR00N A LAKER 4 LYF Y'ALL JUST DONT KNOW BOUT IT YET</h2>

  <p>This is a story about a little girl, Karuna Sudhir Bettahalli. Karuna did not grow up watching sport. Naturally, this meant that she was never 
    introduced to the GOATs. However, this trait about her changes over the course of her MPH journey at NYU, where a stud from the rival school Columbia, 
    introduces her to the absolute legend of LeBron Raymone James. She was stunend. The aura of LeBron completely takes her by a storm she couldn't contain.</p>

    <p>The level of her devotion spiked so high that within a month of reaching New York City, she stood outside the Laker place of stay, Four Seasons Downtown, in the 
        harsh cold of -3 degrees celsius. She is now in contention to be a hall of famer laker fan, right up there with the likes of stars such as Nikhil Kumar Kuppa.

        Stay tuned to see what happens.
